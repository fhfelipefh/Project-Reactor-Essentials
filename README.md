# Project Reactor Essentials

## Reactive Programming

<p> Reactive programming describes a design paradigm that relies on asynchronous programming logic to handle real-time updates to otherwise static content. It provides an efficient means -- the use of automated data streams -- to handle data updates to content whenever a user makes an inquiry. </p>

What is Reactive programming? 

- Reactive programming is about the concepts not implementation
- Event driven
- Data Streams... Data Stream everywhere
- asynchronous
- Non-Blocking
- Backpressure
- Funcitional/Declarative programming

Reactive Streams API Components

> The API consists of the following components that are required to be provided by reactive Stream implementation:

- publisher
- subscriber
- subscription
- processor
